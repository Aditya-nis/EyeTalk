EyeTalk – Eye Blink Decoding Application
📌 Overview

EyeTalk is an assistive communication application designed for individuals who cannot speak. It enables users to communicate effectively by decoding eye blinks into meaningful text or speech. By leveraging eye-tracking and blink-detection algorithms, the system offers a reliable and user-friendly interface for real-time communication.

🚀 Features

Blink-based input detection and decoding

Conversion of blinks into text or synthesized speech

Customizable user interface with predefined messages

Real-time communication with minimal latency

Error handling and debugging mechanisms to improve accuracy

Scalable design for future integration with IoT devices or medical systems

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Languages: Python, Java, C++

Frameworks/Libraries: OpenCV (for eye detection), PyTorch/TensorFlow (if ML is used), Tkinter/JavaFX (for UI)

Database: SQL Server (for storing custom messages and user data)

Other Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Android Studio (for Android UI design)

🔧 How It Works

Detect eye movements and blinks using a webcam or camera sensor.

Apply image-processing algorithms to identify blink patterns.

Map detected blinks to corresponding characters, words, or commands.

Display decoded messages in the UI and/or convert them to speech.

Allow customization of frequently used phrases for faster communication.

📊 Future Improvements

Integration with voice assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant)

Cloud-based message storage for portability

AI/ML-based blink detection for higher accuracy

Mobile app version for accessibility anywhere

Multi-language support
